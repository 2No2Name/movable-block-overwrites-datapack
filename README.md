# Skyblock-datapack
Datapack with lists to overwrite which blocks can be pushed, pulled and broken by pistons. Also adds "weak" stickyness.
# How to use?
- Download the datapack
- Drop the zip file in the datapacks folder of your world

# Change which blocks can be pushed
- Edit the .json files to change which blocks behave how when a piston interacts with them
- Use the weak sticky blocks feature! Those blocks only get dragged along when their way is not obstructed.
